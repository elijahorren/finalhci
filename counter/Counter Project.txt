Eli & Martin's Counter

This project is a simple counter app. The user can increase or decrease the number by 1 or 10, or reset it back to zero.

Design principles used:
- Simplicity: only the buttons needed are shown.
- Consistency: buttons look and work the same way.
- Feedback: the number changes right away when a button is clicked.
- Accessibility: clear text and easy to click buttons.

How they were applied:
The layout is clean with the counter number shown at the top and all buttons grouped together. Each button has simple text so users know what it does.

Why these were chosen:
To make the counter easy to understand, quick to use, and accessible for everyone. The design avoids confusion and gives a smooth user experience.
