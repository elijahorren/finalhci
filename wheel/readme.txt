Color Psychology Spin Wheel

*AI was used for ideas and to refine the README file*

Description:
------------
A simple spin wheel that shows colors and their meanings. 
Click "SPIN" or press the SPACEBAR to spin the wheel. 
The background changes to the selected color, and the result shows the color name and meaning.

Improvements:
-------------
- Added keyboard support (SPACEBAR to spin)
- Background changes to the selected color
- Result text changes color
- First-click popup message
- Hover effect on the wheel
- Button shows "Spinning..." while spinning

Notes:
------
- I kept the CSS and JavaScript inside the HTML file to make it easier to work on.
- If needed, I can separate the CSS and JS into their own files and folders.
