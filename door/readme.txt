Door Project HCI

*AI was only used to refine the README file*

Overview
This project is an extended and redesigned version of the original interface. The redesign includes improved visuals, interaction, and layout to create a more user-friendly experience.

Design Principles, Concepts, and Theories Used
• Visibility
• Feedback
• Consistency
• Aesthetic–Usability Effect
• Affordance

How These Principles Were Applied
• The video is placed inside the main wrapper so the primary content immediately draws attention (visibility).
• Two animated doors open when the user hovers over the wrapper, clearly showing that interaction has occurred (feedback).
• Matching colors, borders, and layout were used across the interface (consistency).
• Enhanced visuals and animation improve the appearance, which supports better user satisfaction and engagement (aesthetic–usability effect).
• Door shapes give the user a natural hint that the element can be interacted with (affordance).

Why These Principles Improve the User Experience
Using these principles makes the interface easier to understand and more enjoyable to use. The user can immediately identify what is important on the screen, receive feedback when interacting, and experience a more visually appealing design. The interaction and animation increase engagement while still maintaining clarity and usability.
