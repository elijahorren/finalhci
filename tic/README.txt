Tic Tac Toe Redesign

Project Overview

This project is an interactive browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The redesign focuses on making the game easier to play, more responsive, and visually clearer for users.

1. Design Principles, Concepts, and Theories Used

User-Centered Design: Focused on making the game simple and easy to understand.

Visual Hierarchy: Made the board and status text stand out so players know what’s happening.

Feedback and Affordance: Gave players instant feedback after each move and disabled used cells.

Consistency and Simplicity: Kept the layout and design clean and uniform.

Game Flow Theory: Made the game move smoothly from one turn to the next.

2. How These Were Applied in the Redesign

These design ideas were used to make the game more fun and easy to use. The board updates right after a player clicks a cell, and the status bar always shows whose turn it is. The code prevents mistakes by stopping players from clicking the same cell twice and ends the game as soon as someone wins. The design is clean and organized so players can focus only on playing, not on figuring out how the game works.

3. Why These Design Choices Improve User Experience

These choices make the game clearer, faster, and more enjoyable. Players always know whose turn it is and can see results instantly. The simple layout helps them stay focused, and the smooth feedback keeps the game fun to play. Overall, the redesign makes the user experience easier and more engaging.
