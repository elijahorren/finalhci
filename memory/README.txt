Memory Game Project

*AI was used to refine the README only*

This is my memory matching game I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a basic setup but it gets the job done.

I kept the JS and CSS in separate folders just so I could work on everything easier. If needed, I can move them into the HTML or switch things around.

What I improved:
- Made the layout cleaner
- Fixed some styling stuff
- Tried to make the game feel smoother overall

Thanks!
